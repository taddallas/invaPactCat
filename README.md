### invaPactCat

This was initiated as part of invaPact, a working group in October 2023 on quantifying impacts of invasive species. The specific goal of this subgroup was to work with the EICAT rankings to incorporate abiotic data to make a potentially more informed measure of invasion impact that could be comparable across species, geographic locations, biomes, etc.
